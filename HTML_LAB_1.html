      <h3 id="what">What is Human Resource Management?</h3>
      <p>Human resource management (HRM or HR) is the strategic approach to the effective management of people in a company or organization such that they help their business gain a competitive advantage. It is designed to maximize employee performance in service of an employer's strategic objectives. Human resource management is primarily concerned with the management of people within organizations, focusing on policies and systems. HR departments are responsible for overseeing employee-benefits design, employee recruitment, training and development, performance appraisal, and reward management, such as managing pay and benefit systems. HR also concerns itself with organizational change and industrial relations, or the balancing of organizational practices with requirements arising from collective bargaining and governmental laws.

      <h3 id="role">Role of HR Management</h3>
      <p>HR is a product of the human relations movement of the early 20th Century, when researchers began documenting ways of creating business value through the strategic management of the workforce. It was initially dominated by transactional work, such as payroll and benefits administration, but due to globalization, company consolidation, technological advances, and further research, HR as of 2015 focuses on strategic initiatives like mergers and acquisitions, talent management, succession planning, industrial and labor relations, and diversity and inclusion. It's prominent functions are:

This can typically be summed up as a sentence or short statement that can also be represented visually. A design concept serves to guide design work. It can also act as a slogan to pitch a design to clients.</p>

      <p>Responsive web design, originally defined by Ethan Marcotte in A List Apart, responds to the needs of the users and the devices they're using. The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device.
